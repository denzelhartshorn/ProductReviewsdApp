## 🚀 Overview
**ProductReviewsdApp** is a decentralized application (dApp) that leverages **Ethereum blockchain technology** to provide a secure and transparent product review system. Built with **Solidity, Truffle, and React**, this project ensures review authenticity and prevents tampering.

## ✨ Features
- **Smart Contract-Based Reviews** – Reviews are securely stored on the blockchain.
- **Decentralized & Tamper-Proof** – Eliminates fake or manipulated reviews.
- **React Frontend** – User-friendly interface for submitting and viewing reviews.
- **Truffle Integration** – Streamlined smart contract deployment and testing.

🎯 How It Works
	1.	Users submit product reviews through the React frontend.
	2.	Reviews are stored on the Ethereum blockchain via a smart contract.
	3.	The frontend fetches and displays reviews from the blockchain, ensuring authenticity.

🔮 Future Improvements
	•	Add user authentication.
	•	Implement a rating system for verified purchases.
	•	Deploy to a public Ethereum testnet.
