## 🚀 Overview
**ProductReviewsdApp** is a decentralized application (dApp) that leverages **Ethereum blockchain technology** to provide a secure and transparent product review system. Built with **Solidity, Truffle, and React**, this project ensures review authenticity and prevents tampering.

## ✨ Features
- **Smart Contract-Based Reviews** – Reviews are securely stored on the blockchain.
- **Decentralized & Tamper-Proof** – Eliminates fake or manipulated reviews.
- **React Frontend** – User-friendly interface for submitting and viewing reviews.
- **Truffle Integration** – Streamlined smart contract deployment and testing.

## 🎯 How It Works
1. Users submit product reviews through the **React frontend**.
2. Reviews are **stored on the Ethereum blockchain** via a **smart contract**.
3. The frontend **fetches and displays** reviews from the blockchain, ensuring **authenticity and transparency**.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Add **user authentication** (e.g., Web3 wallet integration).
- Implement a **rating system** for verified purchases.
- Deploy to a **public Ethereum testnet**.
